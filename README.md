# SHA256-Password-Cracking

<h2>Description</h2>
This script takes a SHA-256 hash as input and attempts to crack it by checking a list of passwords from a file ("rockyou.txt"). It iterates through the password list, hashing each password and comparing it to the provided target hash. If a match is found, it reports the password and the number of attempts it took. The script is intended for password hash cracking and serves as a basic demonstration for educational purposes.
